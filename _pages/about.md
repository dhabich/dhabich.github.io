Iâ€™m Dirk Habich, an Associate Professor at [TU Dresden](https://www.tu-dresden.de), Germany in the [Database Systems Group](https://wwwdb.inf.tu-dresden.de). 

## My work and research

The efficient and scalable processing of large amount of data for analytics with taking into account traditional properties of database systems such as consistency, descriptive query specification as well as longevity, is one of the keystones of many application areas like business, machine learning, big data, data science or the Internet of Things (IoT). As a result, data systems have become significantly more important in recent years. At the same time, data systems are constantly exposed to a broad variety of new requirements, ranging from applications (analytical, transactional or hybrid workloads) to operators (relational model, linear algebra, graph processing, etc.) to various data characteristics (relational data, tensors, graphs, streaming data, etc.). For this reason, my overall research activities are focusing on the design of scalable and adaptive concepts for analytical data systems to satisfy these requirements.
